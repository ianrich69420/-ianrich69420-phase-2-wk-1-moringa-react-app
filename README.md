# Bot Battlr

# Description

This is the project made for the fifth challenge for Moringa School.

In this project is a website in which a user can:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.

- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once** The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.

- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the `YourBotArmy` component.

- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
